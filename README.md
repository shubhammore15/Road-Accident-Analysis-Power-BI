## Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of road accidents using data visualization in Power BI Desktop. It aims to uncover patterns and contributing factors to road accidents, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making in traffic safety and management.

### Problem
The traffic department faced challenges in understanding and addressing the high number of road accidents and casualties. There was a need for a comprehensive analysis to ascertain the underlying patterns and contributing factors.

### Role
As a Data Analyst, my objective was to compile, process, and analyze extensive data on road accidents. The goal was to identify key trends, differentiate between various factors contributing to accidents, and present these findings in an informative and accessible manner.

### Contribution
To achieve this, I employed Power BI Desktop for data visualization. This involved:
- Collecting and integrating data from diverse sources.
- Categorizing and analyzing accidents based on vehicle type, road type, light conditions, and urban vs. rural areas.
- Comparing current year data with previous years to observe trends and changes.
- Creating dynamic and interactive visualizations to clearly represent the findings.

### Visualization and Data
The project includes various charts and graphs that elucidate the accident trends. Key visualizations include:
- Total number of casualties and accidents over time.
- Breakdown by vehicle type and accident location (urban vs. rural).
- Analysis of road types, light conditions, and weather conditions during accidents.

### Result
The final report provided actionable insights, revealing:
- A higher incidence of accidents involving cars, primarily in urban areas.
- Most accidents occurred during daylight under clear weather conditions.
- A year-on-year comparison highlighted specific areas with increased accidents.
These findings enabled the traffic department to target interventions and awareness programs more effectively, potentially reducing future road accidents.

This analysis can serve as a tool for traffic departments, policy makers, and public safety organizations to understand road safety dynamics better and to formulate targeted strategies for reducing road accidents.
